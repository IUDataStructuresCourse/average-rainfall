2. Read the following tutorial for using Github.

   http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/classes/spring2016/csci/c343-yye/github.php

3. Implement a Java program that consumes a space-separated list of
   numbers representing daily rainfall amounts as entered by a user.
   Use
   [java.util.Scanner](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html)
   to obtain the user input.  The list may contain the number -999
   indicating the end of the data of interest.  Output the average of
   the non-negative values in the list up to the first -999 (if it
   shows up).  There may be negative numbers other than -999 in the
   list. Turn in your program by doing a commit and push on your
   version of this repository.
